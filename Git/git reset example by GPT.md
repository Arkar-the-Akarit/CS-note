### Scenario Recap:

- **5 commits**: Each commit adds or modifies one file.
    - **Commit 1**: Adds/Modifies `file1.txt`.
    - **Commit 2**: Adds/Modifies `file2.txt`.
    - **Commit 3**: Adds/Modifies `file3.txt`.
    - **Commit 4**: Adds/Modifies `file4.txt`.
    - **Commit 5**: Adds/Modifies `file5.txt`.

### Using `git reset --soft HEAD~4` (Reset to the first commit):

- **Staging Area**: All 5 files will be staged as modified, ready to be committed again. This is because `--soft` only moves `HEAD` without changing the staging area or working directory.
- **Working Directory**: All 5 files will remain as they were before the reset. Nothing changes in the working directory.
- **Effect**: It's as if you never committed changes 2 through 5, but all the changes are staged and ready for a new commit.

### Using `git reset --mixed HEAD~4` (Reset to the first commit):

- **Staging Area**: The staging area will be reset to match the first commit. This means only `file1.txt` will be staged (if it was staged in the first commit). Files 2 through 5 will be unstaged.
- **Working Directory**: All 5 files will remain in your working directory with their changes intact. The files from commits 2 through 5 will appear as unstaged changes.
- **Effect**: Only the changes from the first commit are staged; the rest are available in the working directory but not staged for commit.

### Using `git reset --hard HEAD~4` (Reset to the first commit):

- **Staging Area**: The staging area will be reset to the state of the first commit, meaning only `file1.txt` is staged (as it was in the first commit).
- **Working Directory**: The working directory will also be reset to match the first commit. This means files 2 through 5 will be removed or reverted to their state in the first commit.
- **Effect**: The changes from commits 2 through 5 will be lost in both the staging area and the working directory, and the repository will look as it did after the first commit.

### Important Note About `git reset --hard`:

- Any untracked files (those not added to the staging area) will remain in the working directory, but all tracked changes that were added to the staging area and committed in commits 2 through 5 will be lost.
